## Project Description
The aim of this project is to create a machine learning model that can predict whether an x-ray image shows signs of pneumonia. 
With the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a large uptake of patients in hospitals that have signs of pneumonia. This program could 
quickly make a prediction of a diagnosis for hundreds, if not thousands, of x-ray images- quicker than a doctor could. 
#### Data Source
Chest x-ray images were pulled from the ["Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)"][1] dataset from Kaggle. We pulled 80 .jpeg images total from this dataset 
for our project. We used 40 images to train the models and 40 images to test the models. In each set of data, we had 20 x-ray images of normal lungs and 20 x-ray 
images of lungs with pneumonia.
